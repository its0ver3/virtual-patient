Types of Disc Herniations
The sources categorize disc injuries into four primary types based on the structural integrity of the annulus fibrosus and the movement of the nucleus pulposus:
• Protrusion: The disc bulges posteriorly but the annulus fibrosus remains intact.
• Prolapse: Only the outermost fibers of the annulus fibrosus contain the nuclear material.
• Extrusion: The annulus fibrosus is perforated, and discal material moves into the epidural space.
• Sequestration: Discal fragments from the annulus and nucleus form outside the disc proper.
Clinical Symptoms and Presentation
• Aggravating and Relieving Factors: Intervertebral disc pain is typically aggravated by sitting and bending forward (flexion). In the lumbar spine, pain is often relieved by lying down, especially in a fetal position.
• Pain Distribution: Cervical disc herniations commonly cause severe neck pain that may radiate into the shoulder, scapula, or arm. Lumbar herniations typically produce back pain, and radicular (leg) pain is considered dominant if it extends below the knee.
• Pressure Sensitivities: Symptoms are often exacerbated by actions that increase intrathecal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, straining, laughing, or deep breathing.
• Severe Complications: A massive central sequestration can lead to cauda equina syndrome, characterized by bowel and bladder paralysis and saddle anesthesia.
Clinical Indicators and Posture
• Lateral Shift (Sciatic List): Patients often adopt an involuntary antalgic posture to alleviate nerve root irritation. If the herniation is lateral to the nerve root, the patient typically lists away from the side of the pain; if the herniation is medial to the nerve root, they list toward the side of pain.
• Range of Motion: Flexion is often limited in acute stages. In the cervical spine, extension may produce radicular symptoms, which is considered an unfavorable prognostic factor.
Special Tests for Diagnosis
Several provocative tests are used to identify disc involvement:
• Straight Leg Raise (SLR): Positive if it reproduces the patient’s radicular symptoms. Pain occurring between 35° and 70° indicates the sciatic nerve roots are tensing over the disc.
• Well Leg Raising Test: Lifting the unaffected leg that produces pain in the symptomatic leg suggests a large, usually medial, protrusion with a poor prognosis for conservative care.
• Slump Test: Used to identify increased tension in the neuromeningeal tract or impingement of the nerve roots by a disc.
• Valsalva Maneuver: Increased pain indicates increased intrathecal pressure, often due to space-occupying lesions like a herniated disc.
Anatomic Considerations and Age
• Lumbar Nerve Root Mapping: Because of the way nerve roots exit, an L4–L5 disc herniation usually compresses the L5 nerve root rather than the L4 root.
• Prevalence: Lumbar disc problems most commonly occur between ages 15 and 40, while cervical herniations are most common between ages 17 and 60.
Mechanism of Injury (MOI)
The mechanisms for disc herniation generally involve forces that increase intradiscal pressure or cause structural failure of the annulus:
• Flexion under Load: Lifting is a primary cause of low back pain and disc injury. The force exerted on the disc is approximately 10 times the weight being lifted.
• Combined Movements: Injury often occurs during quick movements into flexion, rotation, side flexion, or extension, whether or not a load is being carried.
• Sustained and Repetitive Stresses: Prolonged sustained postures or repetitive activities (microtrauma) can lead to the slow onset of disc pathology.
• Direct Pressure: Direct vertical pressure on the disc can cause the nucleus to push fluid into the vertebral body, resulting in Schmorl’s nodules (herniations into the bone).
Symptomatic Picture
The symptomatic presentation varies based on the type of herniation (protrusion, prolapse, extrusion, or sequestration) and the direction of the displacement.
Pain Characteristics
• Aggravating Factors: Discogenic pain is characteristically aggravated by sitting, bending forward (flexion), lifting, and twisting.
• Relieving Factors: Pain is typically relieved by lying down, particularly in a fetal position, which reduces intradiscal pressure.
• Distribution: While central protrusions cause primary back pain, lateral protrusions typically result in dominant leg pain that radiates below the knee.
• Centralization/Peripheralization: Symptoms may move distally into the limb (peripheralization) as the lesion worsens or move toward the midline of the spine (centralization) as it improves.
Neurological and Physical Signs
• Nerve Root Irritation: Pressure on the nerve roots causes radicular pain (sharp/shooting), paresthesia (pins and needles), and muscle weakness in specific myotomes.
• Postural Changes: Patients often adopt a sciatic list or lateral shift (tilting the trunk to one side) to alleviate nerve root pressure. There is also frequently a loss of normal lumbar lordosis due to muscle spasm.
• Clinical Indicators: A positive Straight Leg Raise (SLR) or Slump Test is highly suggestive of disc involvement. A "well leg raising test" (pain in the affected leg when the opposite leg is lifted) indicates a large protrusion with a poor prognosis for conservative care.
• Emergency Signs: Massive central sequestration can lead to cauda equina syndrome, characterized by bowel and bladder paralysis and saddle anesthesia (numbness in the groin/buttocks)

Patient Name: Robert Mitchell (goes by "Bob")
Age: 58
Occupation: Golf course groundskeeper (full-time) - involves prolonged standing, walking on uneven terrain, bending, and equipment operation. Also plays recreational golf 2-3x per week.
Dominant hand: Right

PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Right-sided low back pain with buttock referral for 4 weeks

CASE DETAILS:
- Location: Right-sided low back, localized to the L4-L5 and L5-S1 area (patient points to the right paraspinal region, approximately 2-3cm from midline). Pain refers into the right buttock and posterior thigh, but does NOT go below the knee. No numbness, tingling, or pins and needles anywhere.
- MOI: Gradual onset over 2-3 weeks. No specific injury or incident. Coincides with the start of spring golf season - increased hours at work preparing the course, and resumed playing golf after winter break. Has been playing 2-3 rounds per week and working 45+ hour weeks with lots of standing and walking.
- Nature: This is a subacute condition (4 weeks). Started mildly and has progressively worsened. Now interfering with work and golf.
- Onset: Gradual onset approximately 4 weeks ago. First noticed stiffness in the morning, then developed into more persistent pain. No sudden injury or trauma.
- Pain: 2-3/10 at rest (sitting), 5-6/10 with prolonged standing (>20 minutes), 6-7/10 during golf swing (especially the follow-through rotation), 4/10 walking on flat ground, 6/10 walking on uneven terrain. Worst at end of workday.
- Quality: Deep, aching pain in the low back. Feels "jammed" or "locked" on the right side. Dull referral into buttock and thigh. No sharp, shooting, or burning qualities. No electrical sensations.
- Referral: Pain refers from low back into right buttock and posterior thigh. Stops above the knee. NO referral into lower leg, foot, or toes. NO numbness, tingling, or paresthesia anywhere.
- Systemic: No fever, no night sweats, no unexplained weight loss. No bowel or bladder changes. Generally healthy for his age. Has mild hypertension controlled with medication.
- Timing: Morning stiffness lasting 20-30 minutes that eases with movement. Pain builds throughout the workday with standing and walking. Golf swing (especially rotational follow-through) aggravates significantly. Bending backward or arching the back increases pain. Sitting and bending forward provide relief. Lying on his side with knees bent is most comfortable at night.
- Underlying: Has had occasional low back stiffness over the years that always resolved on its own. No previous significant back injuries. No leg symptoms ever before. Takes lisinopril for blood pressure. Uses ibuprofen as needed for back pain (currently 2-3x daily). No previous imaging of spine.
- HCP: Has not seen a doctor for this episode. Wife suggested massage therapy. Plans to see his doctor if it doesn't improve in the next few weeks.
- Goal: Wants to continue working without pain. Wants to keep playing golf - has a tournament coming up in 6 weeks. Would like to understand what's causing this and how to prevent it.

PERSONALITY: Easygoing and friendly. Uses humor to cope with discomfort ("getting old is not for the faint of heart"). Somewhat stoic - may downplay his pain level initially. Practical and wants straightforward explanations. Not particularly anxious about his condition but getting frustrated that it's not resolving on its own. Appreciates when the therapist relates things to his golf game.

ASSESSMENT RESULTS:
- Observation/Posture: Stands with slight right lateral shift (subtle). Decreased lumbar lordosis. Moves cautiously when changing positions. Slight antalgic gait pattern - shortened stride on right. No visible muscle wasting.
- Active ROM Lumbar Spine: Extension limited (approximately 50%) and reproduces right-sided low back pain - patient says "that's it, that's the pain." Right lateral flexion limited (approximately 40%) with right low back pain. Left lateral flexion limited (approximately 40%) with right low back pain at end-range. Right rotation limited (approximately 50%) with right low back pain. Left rotation limited (approximately 40%) with mild right-sided stiffness. Flexion relatively full (approximately 80-90%) with mild stiffness only - provides some relief of symptoms.
- Passive ROM Lumbar Spine: Similar pattern to active. Extension with overpressure significantly increases right-sided symptoms. Side flexion limited equally bilaterally with right-sided pain. Rotation limited, worse to the right. Flexion full range with soft tissue stretch end-feel, no pain.
- Quadrant Test (Kemp's Test) Right: POSITIVE - combined extension, right lateral flexion, and right rotation with overpressure reproduces the patient's right-sided low back and buttock pain.
- Quadrant Test (Kemp's Test) Left: Negative - combined extension, left lateral flexion, and left rotation produces only mild stiffness, does not reproduce primary symptoms.
- Straight Leg Raise (SLR) Right: NEGATIVE at 80 degrees - no reproduction of back or leg pain. Mild hamstring tightness only.
- Straight Leg Raise (SLR) Left: NEGATIVE at 80 degrees - no symptoms.
- Slump Test: NEGATIVE - no reproduction of back or leg symptoms with full slump position and knee extension bilaterally. Mild hamstring tension only.
- Neurological Screen: Lower extremity myotomes (L2-S1) all 5/5 strength bilaterally. Dermatomes intact to light touch throughout. Knee jerk (L3-L4) and ankle jerk (S1) reflexes normal and equal bilaterally. No neurological deficits.
- Prone Instability Test: NEGATIVE - no excessive movement or pain reproduction with posterior-anterior pressure on lumbar segments.
- Palpation: Significant tenderness over right L4-L5 and L5-S1 facet joints (approximately 2cm lateral to spinous processes). Hypertonic right lumbar erector spinae, especially multifidus and rotatores. Right quadratus lumborum hypertonic and tender. Trigger points in right gluteus medius and right piriformis. Left paraspinals mildly hypertonic. No spinous process tenderness. No step deformity.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Consistent with right L4-L5 and L5-S1 facet joint irritation. Subacute presentation (4 weeks). Classic facet pattern: extension and rotation aggravate, flexion relieves. Capsular pattern present (equally limited side flexion and rotation, limited extension). No neurological involvement. No signs of disc pathology (negative SLR, negative Slump, no radicular symptoms). Likely contributing factors: repetitive rotation (golf), prolonged extension loading (standing), possible age-related facet joint changes.

APPROPRIATE TREATMENT GOALS:
1. Decrease hypertonicity in right lumbar erector spinae (multifidus, rotatores, longissimus) with effleurage, petrissage, and muscle stripping techniques
2. Reduce trigger point activity in right gluteus medius and piriformis with TrP treatment protocol
3. Decrease hypertonicity in right quadratus lumborum with origin-insertion technique and positional release
4. Improve joint mobility and decrease facet joint irritation through gentle joint play/mobilizations (within RMT scope) and positioning
5. Promote circulation and decrease pain in affected area with general Swedish techniques
6. Address left-sided compensatory hypertonicity with general relaxation techniques
7. Improve tolerance to rotation through gradual soft tissue release and positioning

APPROPRIATE HOME CARE:
- Lumbar flexion stretches: single knee to chest, double knee to chest (hold 30 seconds, repeat 3-5 times)
- Cat-camel exercise for gentle spinal mobility (emphasis on flexion phase for relief)
- Avoid prolonged standing - take sitting breaks every 20-30 minutes
- Avoid sustained or repeated lumbar extension (arching backward)
- When standing for long periods, place one foot on a small stool to reduce lumbar lordosis
- Ice to right low back after aggravating activities (15-20 minutes)
- Gentle walking on flat surfaces for exercise (avoid uneven terrain temporarily)
- Golf modifications: shorten backswing, reduce rotational force, consider using a cart more frequently
- Piriformis and gluteal stretching (figure-4 stretch)
- Core stability exercises once acute symptoms settle (bird-dog, dead bug - avoid extension-biased exercises)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Facet joint irritation typically responds well to conservative care. Most patients see significant improvement within 4-8 weeks with appropriate treatment and activity modification. Recommend 1-2x/week treatment initially, reassess at 3-4 weeks. May need to address underlying factors (golf mechanics, work ergonomics) for long-term prevention. If no improvement after 6-8 weeks of conservative care, consider referral to physician for further investigation (imaging, possible facet joint injection).

CAUTIONS: First treatment - treat conservatively. Avoid positioning in sustained extension. Monitor for any development of neurological symptoms (would suggest different/additional pathology). Pain should not refer further down the leg with treatment. If radicular symptoms develop (pain below knee, numbness, tingling, weakness), reassess and consider referral. Patient takes blood pressure medication - ensure comfortable positioning and gradual position changes.

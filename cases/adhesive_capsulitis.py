Patient Name: Margaret "Maggie" Okafor
Age: 56
Occupation: Elementary school teacher (grade 3) - writes on the board, reaches shelves, lifts supplies
Dominant hand: Right
Affected side: Left (nondominant)

PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Left shoulder stiffness and progressive loss of motion for approximately 8 months. Also experiencing left neck and upper trapezius pain.

CASE DETAILS:
- Location: Left shoulder, generalized deep ache. Also left neck and upper trapezius area - tight, knotted, achy. No radiating pain into the arm. No numbness or tingling.
- MOI: No injury, no trauma, no surgery. This is a primary (idiopathic) case. Maggie first noticed she was having trouble reaching a high shelf at school about 8 months ago. The stiffness came on gradually with no apparent cause.
- Nature: This is a progressive condition of approximately 8 months duration. Maggie is currently in the frozen stage. The first 4-5 months were dominated by significant pain (freezing stage). Over the past 3 months, the severe pain has diminished, but stiffness has remained. Range of motion is NOT currently improving on its own - it is staying about the same.
- Onset: Insidious, gradual. No specific event or injury. Pain came first, then progressive stiffness developed. By the time she saw her doctor (about 3 months in), she had already lost significant range of motion.
- Pain: Currently 2-3/10 at rest. 5-6/10 at end range of shoulder movements. Was much worse before - 7-8/10 constantly during the first few months, with severe night pain that regularly disrupted sleep. Night pain has mostly improved but she still wakes occasionally if she rolls onto her left side. Neck and upper trapezius pain is 4-5/10, especially by the end of the school day after writing on the board and reaching for supplies.
- Quality: Deep, dull ache in shoulder. Pulling, tight, restricted sensation at end range of shoulder movements. Neck and upper trapezius feels tight, knotted, and achy - like a tension headache that sits in the muscle.
- Referral: No radiating pain down the arm. No numbness or tingling in the hand or fingers. The neck and upper trap pain does not refer into the head or arm.
- Systemic: Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 8 years ago, managed with metformin. HbA1c is reasonably well controlled (last check was 7.1). No thyroid disease. No fever, no night sweats, no unexplained weight loss. No history of cardiac events. General health is otherwise reasonable. BMI is slightly elevated.
- Timing: Stiffness is worst in the morning - takes 30-45 minutes to loosen up. Neck and upper trapezius pain builds throughout the school day, especially after writing on the board or reaching for things overhead. End of day is the worst. Cold weather seems to make the stiffness worse. Weekends are slightly better because she is not using the shoulder as much for work tasks.
- Underlying: No previous shoulder injuries or surgeries on either side. No history of shoulder trauma. Has type 2 diabetes (risk factor for adhesive capsulitis). No other musculoskeletal conditions. Takes metformin daily and occasional ibuprofen (1-2x/week when shoulder or neck pain is bothersome).
- HCP: Saw Dr. Williams (family physician) approximately 5 months ago. Doctor performed clinical exam and diagnosed adhesive capsulitis based on the pattern of progressive motion loss, capsular pattern restriction, and absence of trauma. No imaging was ordered. Doctor referred to physiotherapy - Maggie completed 6 weeks of physio (exercises, some manual therapy). The exercises helped maintain what range she had but did not significantly improve the stiffness. Doctor discussed the possibility of a cortisone injection but Maggie prefers to avoid it if possible. Doctor then referred for massage therapy.
- Goal: Wants to be able to reach overhead to use shelves at school and put up classroom displays. Wants to fasten her bra behind her back again. Wants to wash and style her hair more easily - currently has to modify how she does it. Wants the neck and upper trapezius pain to go away. Wants to understand how long this condition will take to resolve and what she can do to help.

PERSONALITY: Pragmatic and direct. A teacher by nature - she likes clear explanations and appreciates when things are laid out logically. Somewhat frustrated with the slow progress and the lack of a clear timeline, but not anxious or panicky. She has done some reading about frozen shoulder online and may ask informed questions. She is cooperative and will openly share information when asked the right questions. She gets a bit emotional when talking about how the condition affects her independence - especially personal care tasks like doing her hair and getting dressed. She appreciates honest, straightforward communication and does not respond well to vague reassurances. She may ask "How long will this take?" or "Is there anything that will speed this up?"

IMPORTANT PATIENT RESPONSES:
- When asked if range has been improving, staying the same, or getting worse: "It's been staying about the same for the past couple of months. It was getting worse for a while, but now it seems to have plateaued. The stiffness isn't getting worse, but it's not getting better either."
- When asked about pain progression: "The pain is actually better than it was a few months ago. In the beginning it was constant and really bad - I couldn't sleep. Now it's more of an ache, and it mainly hurts when I try to move the shoulder to its limit."
- When asked about the neck/trap pain: "That's actually what bothers me most day to day. My shoulder is stiff but I've gotten used to working around it. The neck and trap pain is what really gets to me by the end of the school day."
- When asked about trauma or injury: "No, nothing happened. It just started on its own. I keep trying to think of what I did but there was no injury."
- When asked about diabetes: "Yes, I've had type 2 diabetes for about 8 years. I take metformin. My doctor said the diabetes might be related to the shoulder problem."

ASSESSMENT RESULTS:
- Observation/Posture: Left shoulder held in slight adduction and internal rotation with the forearm resting closer to the abdomen. Mild elevation of the left shoulder compared to the right. Left upper trapezius is visibly hypertonic. No visible atrophy of the deltoid or rotator cuff musculature at this stage.
- Active ROM Left Shoulder: Flexion limited to approximately 100 degrees (normal 180). Abduction limited to approximately 80 degrees with visible compensatory scapular elevation early in range. External rotation with arm at side limited to approximately 15 degrees (normal 90) - most restricted motion. Internal rotation with arm at side limited to approximately 40 degrees (normal 70-80). Extension limited to approximately 35 degrees (normal 50) with mild pulling. All end-range movements produce pain (5-6/10). Capsular pattern of restriction is present (external rotation most limited, then abduction, then internal rotation, then flexion).
- Passive ROM Left Shoulder: Matches active ROM in all directions. Flexion approximately 100 degrees with abnormal leathery end feel. Abduction approximately 80 degrees with abnormal leathery end feel. External rotation approximately 15 degrees with abnormal leathery end feel - most restricted. Internal rotation approximately 40 degrees with abnormal leathery end feel. All passive movements have a firm, leathery end feel that is not normal. PROM equals AROM in all directions.
- Resisted ROM Left Shoulder: Flexion 4/5 with mild pain. Abduction 4/5 with mild pain. External rotation 3+/5 with pain and weakness - weakest motion. Internal rotation 4/5 with mild discomfort. Generally reduced compared to right side, consistent with pain and disuse. No specific pattern suggesting isolated tendon or nerve pathology.
- Active ROM Right Shoulder (comparison): All movements full range, pain-free. Normal quality of movement.
- Active ROM Cervical Spine: Full range in all directions. Mild tightness with left lateral flexion and left rotation. No pain referral. No neurological symptoms.
- Scapulohumeral Rhythm: Abnormal on the left. Early scapular elevation occurs within the first 30 degrees of arm elevation (should not occur until approximately 60 degrees). Decreased glenohumeral joint motion with excessive scapular contribution. Reverse scapulohumeral rhythm evident. Excessive lateral trunk bend when attempting to reach overhead. Right side shows normal scapulohumeral rhythm for comparison.
- Speed's Test: NEGATIVE - no pain in the bicipital groove. No biceps tendon pathology suggested.
- Empty Can Test (Supraspinatus): Cannot be tested in the standard position due to insufficient abduction range. From available range, mild weakness is noted consistent with general disuse, but no sharp pain suggesting acute tendon pathology.
- Drop Arm Test: Cannot be fully tested as patient cannot achieve full abduction. From maximum available abduction (approximately 80 degrees), the patient can control the lowering of the arm without sudden drop. No rotator cuff tear suggested.
- Lift-Off Sign (Gerber's): Cannot achieve test position due to insufficient internal rotation range. Inability to position the arm is consistent with capsular restriction rather than subscapularis pathology.
- Apley's Scratch Test (Behind the Back Reach): Significantly limited on the left. From below (internal rotation/extension), left hand cannot reach past lower thoracic spine (right hand reaches mid-thoracic). From above (flexion/external rotation/abduction), left hand cannot reach past the top of the head (right hand reaches between the scapulae).
- Palpation: Multiple active trigger points in left upper trapezius. Trigger point in left levator scapulae. Taut bands and tenderness in left infraspinatus. Left posterior deltoid tender. Left pectoralis major shortened and tender, especially sternal fibers. Left subscapularis tender on palpation through the axilla. Left supraspinatus tender along its belly. Right shoulder musculature is nontender for comparison.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Consistent with primary (idiopathic) glenohumeral capsule fibrosis (adhesive capsulitis) of moderate severity in the frozen phase. The patient's pain has diminished from the freezing phase but stiffness remains. Range of motion is not currently improving on its own, indicating the condition has not yet entered the thawing phase. Secondary myofascial dysfunction in the left upper trapezius and periscapular muscles is present due to compensatory movement patterns. Type 2 diabetes is a relevant comorbidity that may affect healing timeline.

APPROPRIATE TREATMENT GOALS (supportive/maintenance approach - ROM is NOT improving on its own):
1. Decrease trigger point activity in left upper trapezius with trigger point treatment protocol (ischemic compression, muscle stripping)
2. Decrease hypertonicity in left levator scapulae and upper trapezius with petrissage and segmental muscle stripping
3. Maintain tissue health around left shoulder girdle with effleurage and petrissage to deltoid, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and pectoralis major
4. Perform pain-free mid-range passive ROM to left GH joint in multiple directions to maintain joint health and reduce stiffness
5. Address pectoralis major shortening with petrissage and gentle origin-insertion technique within pain-free range
6. Support neuromuscular function of rotator cuff and scapular stabilisers with pain-free isometric facilitation

INAPPROPRIATE TREATMENT AT THIS STAGE:
- Do NOT challenge the joint capsule
- Do NOT perform grade 2-3 sustained mobilisations or grade 3-4 oscillations
- Do NOT take the joint to its end range during limb handling or PROM
- Do NOT perform end-range stretching
- The cost of a setback in healing far outweighs any marginal improvements from one aggressive treatment

APPROPRIATE HOME CARE:
- Pendulum exercises (Codman's) for passive motion, joint health, and to reduce stiffness - 3x daily, pain-free
- Pain-free active or active-assisted ROM in mid-range for all shoulder motions
- Pain-free isometric exercises for all shoulder motions and muscles (especially external rotators, abductors, and scapular stabilisers)
- Ice for analgesia 10-15 minutes after any aggravating activity
- Education regarding rest and relief positions - prop the arm away from the side with a pillow (loose-packed/resting position of the GH joint)
- Avoid pushing through pain or forcing range of motion
- Avoid sleeping on the affected side - use a pillow to support the arm

INAPPROPRIATE HOME CARE AT THIS STAGE:
- Do NOT prescribe aggressive stretching
- Do NOT prescribe end-range exercises
- Do NOT prescribe progressive strengthening or return-to-function activities (these are appropriate only when ROM is improving on its own in the thawing phase)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES: The timeline for adhesive capsulitis is highly variable and controversial. The overall duration may range from 1 to over 2 years. Most people (approximately 90%) see improvements sufficient for activities of daily living, though full range is not always regained. The fact that Maggie's pain has diminished is a positive sign, but range is not yet improving. Treatment at this stage focuses on maintaining neuromuscular control, managing secondary dysfunction, and preventing the ill effects of disuse. Once range begins to improve on its own (thawing phase), treatment can shift to a corrective approach to restore range and function. Diabetes may extend the overall timeline. Recommend treatment 1x/week, reassess every 4-6 weeks for signs of entering the thawing phase.

CAUTIONS: First treatment - treat conservatively. Do not challenge the GH joint capsule. Perform mid-range PROM only - do not take to end range. Monitor pain response carefully between treatments. If pain increases or function decreases after a treatment, the approach was too aggressive. Diabetes may affect tissue healing and overall timeline. If the patient develops new neurological symptoms, acute worsening of pain, or systemic symptoms, refer back to physician. The switch from supportive/maintenance to corrective treatment should only occur when ROM is reliably improving on its own with minimal to no pain at end range.

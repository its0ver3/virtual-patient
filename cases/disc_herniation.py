PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Low back pain with left leg radiculopathy for 3 weeks

CASE DETAILS:
- Location: Central-left low back at L4-L5 level. Pain radiates into left buttock, posterior thigh, and down into the lateral calf. Occasional pins and needles in the left foot (dorsum).
- MOI: Was lifting a heavy box (approximately 30 lbs) at work while twisting to place it on a shelf. Felt a sudden sharp pain in low back. Pain has progressively worsened over the following days, with leg symptoms developing about 3 days after the initial injury.
- Nature: This is a subacute condition (3 weeks). Was initially acute but has settled somewhat. Still significant pain with certain positions and movements.
- Onset: Sudden onset 3 weeks ago during lifting/twisting. Leg pain began 3 days later. Has not significantly improved despite rest and medication.
- Pain: 4/10 at rest (lying down), 7-8/10 with prolonged sitting (>20 minutes), 6/10 standing, 8/10 bending forward. Leg pain is 5-6/10 and described as shooting/burning.
- Quality: Deep, aching in low back. Sharp, shooting, burning pain down the leg. Pins and needles in left foot intermittently.
- Referral: Pain radiates from low back into left buttock, posterior thigh, lateral calf, and dorsum of left foot. Follows approximate L5 dermatome distribution.
- Systemic: No fever, no night sweats, no unexplained weight loss. No bowel or bladder changes. No saddle anesthesia. Generally healthy.
- Timing: Worst in the morning (stiff for 30-45 minutes). Sitting aggravates significantly after 20 minutes. Standing is tolerable but not comfortable. Lying in fetal position on right side provides most relief. Coughing, sneezing, and straining all increase pain. Worse at end of workday.
- Underlying: Had one mild episode of low back pain 2 years ago that resolved on its own in a few days. No previous leg symptoms. No history of spinal surgery. Takes ibuprofen 400mg as needed (2-3x daily currently).
- HCP: Saw Dr. Patel (family physician) 2 weeks ago. Doctor performed basic neuro exam, suspected L4-L5 disc herniation based on positive SLR and symptom pattern. Prescribed NSAIDs, advised activity modification, referred for massage therapy. MRI not yet ordered - doctor wants to try conservative care first.
- Goal: Wants to get back to work without restrictions. Currently on modified duties (desk only, no lifting). Wants to be able to sit comfortably for work meetings. Worried about whether this is permanent.

PERSONALITY: Anxious about her condition. Asks a lot of questions about prognosis - "Will I need surgery?" "Is this permanent?" Somewhat guarded physically - nervous about movements that might increase pain. Cooperative but needs reassurance. Tends to catastrophize slightly. Appreciates when the therapist explains what they're doing and why.

ASSESSMENT RESULTS:
- Observation/Posture: Visible left lateral shift (trunk shifted to the right, away from painful side - consistent with lateral herniation). Loss of normal lumbar lordosis. Guarded movements, slow to change positions.
- Active ROM Lumbar Spine: Flexion significantly limited (approximately 40%) and reproduces back and leg pain. Extension limited (approximately 30%) with central back pain only. Left lateral flexion limited and reproduces leg symptoms. Right lateral flexion full with mild back stiffness. Rotation mildly limited bilaterally.
- Passive ROM Lumbar Spine: Similar limitations to active. Overpressure into flexion significantly increases leg pain (peripheralization). Repeated extension centralizes symptoms slightly.
- Straight Leg Raise (SLR) Left: POSITIVE at 40 degrees - reproduces radiating leg pain into calf. Dorsiflexion of ankle at 40 degrees increases symptoms (sensitizing maneuver).
- Straight Leg Raise (SLR) Right: Negative at 70 degrees. No reproduction of left-sided symptoms.
- Well Leg Raise: NEGATIVE - raising the right leg does not produce left-sided symptoms. This is a favorable prognostic indicator.
- Slump Test: POSITIVE - reproduces left leg pain when left knee extended and neck flexed. Relieved with neck extension.
- Valsalva Maneuver: POSITIVE - bearing down increases low back and left leg pain.
- Neurological Screen: L5 myotome (extensor hallucis longus - big toe extension) mildly weak on left (4/5). L5 dermatome - decreased sensation to light touch on dorsum of left foot. Reflexes normal bilaterally.
- Palpation: Significant paraspinal muscle spasm L3-S1 bilaterally, worse on left. Tenderness over L4-L5 spinous process. Trigger points in left gluteus medius, piriformis, and hamstrings. Left quadratus lumborum hypertonic.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Consistent with L4-L5 posterolateral disc prolapse (left) compressing L5 nerve root. Subacute phase. Favorable prognostic indicators: negative well leg raise, only mild neurological deficit, some centralization with extension. No red flags (no cauda equina signs).

APPROPRIATE TREATMENT GOALS:
1. Decrease paraspinal muscle hypertonicity and spasm with effleurage, petrissage, and segmental muscle stripping to lumbar erector spinae
2. Reduce trigger point activity in left gluteus medius with TrP treatment protocol
3. Decrease hypertonicity in left quadratus lumborum with origin-insertion technique and positional release
4. Promote circulation and decrease pain in affected area with gentle effleurage and rhythmic techniques
5. Improve tolerance to lumbar extension (centralization principle) through gentle positioning and MFR
6. Reduce neural tension through gentle positioning (avoid sustained flexion)

APPROPRIATE HOME CARE:
- Prone press-ups (McKenzie extension exercise) - start with prone lying, progress to press-ups as tolerated
- Avoid prolonged sitting (break every 20 minutes, stand and gently extend)
- Ice to low back for 10-15 minutes after aggravating activities
- Gentle walking on flat surfaces (10-15 minutes, pain-free)
- Lumbar roll/support when sitting to maintain lordosis
- Avoid bending, lifting, and twisting - use proper body mechanics when returning to activity
- Neural flossing/gliding for sciatic nerve (gentle, pain-free range only)

EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Most disc prolapses (without sequestration) respond well to conservative care. 80-90% of patients improve significantly within 6-12 weeks. Negative well leg raise and mild neuro deficit are favorable signs. Recommend 1-2x/week treatment initially, reassess at 4-6 weeks. If no improvement or worsening neuro signs, refer back to physician for imaging.

CAUTIONS: First treatment - treat very conservatively. Avoid sustained lumbar flexion positioning. Monitor for any changes in bowel/bladder function or progressive neurological deficit (red flags requiring immediate medical referral). Pain during exercise should not peripheralize (move further down the leg). Any increase in numbness or weakness requires reassessment. Do not use deep pressure directly over the spine.
